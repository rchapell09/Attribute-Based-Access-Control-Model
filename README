Hello this file is just to clarify information about the project.

name: Robert Chapell
ID: 1210539574
Language chosen :	Python3

**********************INPUT FILE/LOADFILE********************

the expected INPUT FILE has the syntax as follows (this sample text will load properly as an example)

ATTRS = <Role, role>; <String, fileName>; <String, fileOwnerName>;<AbstractTime, currentTime>
PERMS = <PW>; <PR>
PA = <fileName, grades.txt>; <role, Student>; <currentTime,WithinOH> : PR - <fileName, grades.txt>;<role, Professor>; <currentTime, WithinOH> : PR 
ENTITIES = <Josie>;<Carlos>;<Kyle>;<ENV>;<GradesFile>
AA = <Josie> : <role, Student>; <Carlos> : <role, Professor>


its very IMPORTANT that:
 there are no extra spaces at the end of the line,
 there are no extra spaces between names and commas, but there MUST be ONE space between items and commas
 There must be a space between Colon and Dash(-) items
	it does not matter if there is a ; at the end of the line or not


if the format/ syntax of the loaded file meets the format of the  sample text, then the code should execute just as expected.

I have provided the 3 input files that will work as expected with my program without any errors. These files are provided to give ease of grading, and/or give a template for whats expected as input.

****************COMMAND LINE****************************
when running the file in the terminal it will accept

./abacmonitor "with expected commands; in these quotations,"

the quotations are neccesary to run the program
